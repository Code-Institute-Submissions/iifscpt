            <p>IIFSC Skater Development Profiling Tool is designed with the aim to quantify and track our skater's development thereby encouraging improvement through progressive recognition of individual achievements. The following strength and conditioning assessment were selected to cover 3 critical sport specific skill components in figure skating.</p>
            <div class="ABC">
                <h6>Agility, Balance and Coordination</h6>
                <p class="para">Nearly all figure skating technique requires agility, balance and coordination. In the context of skating skills, agility is the ability to quickly move from one position or direction to another while maintaining balance and coordination. Balance is the ability to maintain the body in position with steadiness and poise. Coordination is the ability to move various body parts simultaneously as required and to combine certain movements in sequence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="PS">
                <h6>Power and Strength</h6>
                <p class="para">Strength and power are the basis for critical skating skills such as jumping, spinning and skating with excellent acceleration and sustained speed. Having appropriate muscular strength and power can help improve explosiveness of jumping, control body stability and improve skating quality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="F">
                <h6>Flexibility</h6>
                <p class="para">Flexibility is an important component for maintaining muscle and joint elasticity and range of motion. Certain skills and movements in figure skating require a full and functional range of motion and flexibility. It is important to maintain and improve these aspects through routine stretching and range of motion exercises before and after skating practice and performance.</p>
