## Code Institute Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Front-end Development

### Athlete Development Profiling Tool

This project aims to quantify and track a figure skater's development as an athlete for high performance pathway through profiling. It will allow individual skaters to map out their own progress goals with coaches' guidance whilst highlighting possible improvement areas. It is also a visualization tool for skaters to be more aware of their strong components vs. weak components for a better understanding of on ice performance.

The following are the stakeholders:
1. Skaters / Skater's Parents
2. Skater's Coach

### UX - User Experience

![Interactive Web Design](video)


![Color Chart](images/iifsc_colorchart.png)
IIFSC base colors were used for uniformity. IIFSC's logo represents the blades and scratch lines made on ice when a figure skater draws / cuts an image on ice. Both blades were chosen in pink and blue to signify gender neutrality whislt one being larger than the other to represent the bond between parent(educator/coach/nurturer) and child(student). 

![Font Gylps](images/athletedp_fontgylps.png)
Julius Sans One and Montserrat (san-serif family) were selected as font-pair for this project to portray IIFSC's lean yet no nonsense approach towards setting a higher bar for the figure skating community.
