## Code Institute Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Front-end Development

### Athlete Development Profiling Tool

This project aims to quantify and track a figure skater's development as an athlete for high performance pathway through profiling. It will allow individual skaters to map out their own progress goals with coaches' guidance whilst highlighting possible improvement areas. It is also a visualization tool for skaters to be more aware of their strong components vs. weak components for a better understanding of on ice performance.

The following are the stakeholders:
1. Skaters / Skater's Parents
2. Skater's Coach
